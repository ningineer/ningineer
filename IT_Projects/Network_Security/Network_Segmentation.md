# Implementing Network Segmentation for Security Enhancement

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational and security best practice purposes within authorized network environments. Ensure proper permissions before implementing these configurations in a production environment.

## Project Overview
- **Technology Used:** VLANs, Subnetting, Firewalls, Network Access Control (NAC), Zero Trust Principles
- **Purpose:** Improve network security by segmenting internal resources to minimize attack surfaces and contain potential breaches.
- **Output:** A structured and segmented network with enforced security policies and access controls.

## Prerequisites
- Network infrastructure with managed switches and firewalls
- Administrative access to network devices
- Understanding of VLANs, IP subnetting, and firewall rules

## Setup and Implementation

### Step 1: Define Network Segments
#### 1. Identify Critical Assets and Traffic Flows
- Separate sensitive systems (e.g., database servers, financial systems) from general user access.
- Define VLANs for different departments or security zones (e.g., HR, Finance, Guest, IoT).

#### 2. Create VLANs and Assign IP Subnets
Example VLAN structure:
| VLAN ID | Name           | Subnet         |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 10      | Management    | 192.168.10.0/24 |
| 20      | HR            | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| 30      | Finance       | 192.168.30.0/24 |
| 40      | Guest         | 192.168.40.0/24 |
| 50      | IoT Devices   | 192.168.50.0/24 |

### Step 2: Configure VLANs on Network Switches
#### 1. Create VLANs on a Cisco Switch
```sh
configure terminal
vlan 10
  name Management
vlan 20
  name HR
vlan 30
  name Finance
vlan 40
  name Guest
vlan 50
  name IoT
exit
```
#### 2. Assign VLANs to Switch Ports
```sh
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
exit
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 20
exit
```

### Step 3: Implement Firewall Rules for Segmented Access
#### 1. Block Unauthorized Inter-VLAN Traffic
```sh
access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.50.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 100 permit ip any any
```
#### 2. Allow Limited Access Between Segments
```sh
access-list 101 permit tcp 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 eq 443
```

### Step 4: Implement Network Access Control (NAC)
#### 1. Enable 802.1X Authentication for Device Control
- Configure RADIUS authentication for user and device validation before granting network access.

#### 2. Apply Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)
- Assign policies restricting access based on user roles and department needs.

### Step 5: Monitor and Enforce Network Security Policies
#### 1. Enable Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)
- Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and block suspicious activities within network segments.

#### 2. Configure Logging and Auditing
- Enable logging for all firewall and switch activities.
```sh
logging enable
logging host 192.168.10.100
```

## Validation & Testing
- Verify VLAN assignments and device connectivity.
- Test firewall rules to ensure restricted access where necessary.
- Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.

## Key Features
- **Isolated Network Segments for Security**
- **Strict Access Control with VLANs and Firewalls**
- **Enhanced Visibility with Logging and IDS/IPS**
- **NAC for Device and User Authentication**

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with SDN for dynamic network segmentation.
- Implement microsegmentation using Zero Trust principles.
- Automate security policy enforcement with AI-driven analytics.

## Conclusion
Network segmentation significantly improves security by restricting lateral movement and reducing attack surfaces. By implementing VLANs, firewall rules, and NAC, organizations can achieve a more secure and manageable network.
